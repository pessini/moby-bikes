[Moby bikes](https://mobybikes.com/) is an e-bike bike-share scheme in operation in Dublin. Electric powered bicycles may be rented from and returned to designated cycle stands inside the designated area.


## Problem Statement

As part of Moby Operations, there is a role called "_eBike Operators_" which among its responsibilities are distributing and relocating eBikes throughout the city, while performing safety checks and basic maintenance.

**To optimize operations, we want to predict the demand for the next hours based on weather data in order to decide whether to increase fleet or is safe to perform safety checks and maintenance and even to collect bikes for repair.**
