# Moby Bikes - Rental Prediction

The project will use two main open datasets provided from Moby and Met Éireann to predict the number of rentals on a day based on weather conditions.

Using Spark and Python.

API provided from Met Éireann and Moby Bikes.

## Dataset

All datasets are public and available at [Data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/) which is a open data portal provided by the Government of Ireland :ireland:

[PhoenixPark Daily Data - Datasets - data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/phoenixpark-daily-data)

[Moby Bikes bikeshare - Datasets - data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/moby-bikes)

__Tasks__

- Based on weather forecast what demand Moby will have? So they can prepare themselves for a high or low demand. Maybe they need to use the time on a low-demand day to focus on fixing or replacing their broken bikes.

- Possible task. Predict the demand based on their bases.



Several studies reported the influence of the weather on usage of bicycle sharing in many cities around the world[[1]](#1)[[2]](#2)..
