## In a nutshell

The project will use two main open datasets provided from Moby and Met Éireann to predict the number of rentals on a day based on weather conditions.

## Problem

The role of **eBike Operators** includes distributing and relocating eBikes throughout the city, while performing safety checks and basic maintenance.

- Based on weather forecast what demand Moby will have? So they can prepare themselves for a high or low demand. Maybe they need to use the time on a low-demand day to focus on fixing or replacing their broken bikes.

### Job Description:

MOBY is Ireland’s most exciting urban mobility company. We deployed a fleet of shared electric bikes in the nation’s capital.


### Responsibilities:

- **Distributing bikes to the city’s most in-demand locations (Cycling electric cargo trike).**
- **Replacing bike batteries when out of charge.**
- **Check and repair eBikes on street.**

## Data Pipeline



## Success Metrics

- KPI

To measure this success it would have to collect how many bikes have broken in the past leading to a possible lost of rental for the company.

The battery data have negative and missing values. Unfortunately 

## Dataset

All datasets are public and available at [Data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/) which is a open data portal provided by the Government of Ireland :ireland:

* [PhoenixPark Daily Data - Datasets - data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/phoenixpark-daily-data)

* [Moby Bikes bikeshare - Datasets - data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/moby-bikes)
